In order to make it easier and quicker to write modules(Payment/Shipping/Order Totals) a new infrastructure for these modules has been created.

This new infrastructure will reduce the amount of boilerplate code required, minimize copy/paste coding and adds helpers for common coding requirements.

Previous Payment/Shipping/Order total modules will continue to work without modification.
