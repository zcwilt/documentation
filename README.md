## Local Dev Testing

First ensure that Hugo (v0.53 or greater) is installed on your system. On a Mac, use Homebrew:

```
brew install hugo && brew upgrade hugo
```

Installing Hugo on Windows takes a few more steps; do a web search for the most current instructions. 

Once you have installed Hugo, fork this repository into your own github account, and then clone this project locally and do a submodule update to get all its dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/documentation.git zendocs
cd zendocs
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Now the site can be served locally with Hugo. During development, you can have Hugo spin up a local webserver and watch for changes.

```
cd zendocs
hugo server
```

The repository is based on the [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/) Documentation Template, in case you need a reference for troubleshooting purposes.

### Docker 

A docker-compose.yml is included. Please see documentation for your OS for installing docker & docker-comppose. 
using `docker-compose up` you can access the server on `localhost:1313`
